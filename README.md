# 🔓 SPOOFED LOGS

> "History is written by the victors. Or in this case, by a Python script."

### ⚠️ System Anomaly Detected
This repository serves as a **Proof of Concept (PoC)** demonstrating Git metadata manipulation and temporal spoofing. 

The contribution graph associated with this repository is not a reflection of time, but a reflection of code. It challenges the concept of "digital productivity" by injecting engineered data packets into the GitHub timeline.

### 🛠️ Technical Specs
* **Vector:** Python Scripting & Git Objects
* **Payload:** Time-traveling commits via `GIT_AUTHOR_DATE`
* **Visual Output:** 7x52 Pixel Art Injection (`[ SPOOFED ]`)
* **Noise Level:** 3% Random Glitch Injection
